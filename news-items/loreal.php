                        <p class="animate animate--fade-up-25"><strong>L’Oréal New Zealand country manager Aurelie de Cremiers says a review was undertaken to deliver an increased focus on creative development and delivery to the New Zealand business: “L’Oréal is recognised as the largest cosmetics, skincare and haircare house in the world, and the leading beauty company in New Zealand. We are very ambitious to drive further growth and the appointment of Federation as our design agency partner for our Consumer Products Division is an exciting development. They share our passion for L’Oréal brands to meet the diverse beauty needs of even more New Zealanders.”</strong></p>
                        <p class="animate animate--fade-up-25">Says Daina Wilson, marketing director for L’Oréal’s Consumer Products Division: “The move to Federation brings fresh energy and innovation to three of the world’s greatest brands, L’Oréal Paris, Garnier and Maybelline. Our products are found in all major department stores, pharmacies and supermarkets so it was critical for us to appoint an agency with a deep understanding of New Zealand consumers at both a brand and retail level. With the appointment of Federation, we are looking forward to driving innovation throughout the customer journey for all of our current and future consumer advocates.</p>
						<p class="animate animate--fade-up-25">“Since COVID-19, it’s become more important than ever to deliver creative campaigns that genuinely resonate with New Zealanders. As a New Zealand agency with critical resources across global brand management, retail, production, CRM and social, Federation is the perfect fit for us. A key criteria of our review was also finding an agency partner who shares our values and we have found a great cultural fit with the Federation team.</p>
						<p class="animate animate--fade-up-25">“The agency transition has now taken place and Federation has commenced working with us.”</p>
						<p class="animate animate--fade-up-25">Says Sharon Henderson, CEO of Federation: “The team at L’Oréal have been fantastic to get to know and are world class. We are incredibly excited and proud to be appointed as agency guardians of their Consumer Products Division brands. Everyone in Team L’Oreal at Federation has been hand-picked based on their passion for L’Oréal’s brands and the category, along with their global brand expertise and international experience.”</p>
						<p class="animate animate--fade-up-25">Says Elizabeth Beatty, managing partner, Federation: “It’s an absolute privilege to have the opportunity to work with such an amazing team and with such an incredible organisation. Also, there will be very few people in New Zealand with a lipstick collection as extensive as mine, so winning L’Oréal is a dream come true for a lipstickophile like me!”</p>
