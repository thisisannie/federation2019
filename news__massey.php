						<p class="animate animate--fade-up-25">CEO, Sharon Henderson says, “It’s a fantastic win that will see Federation lead the charge as creative agency, partnering with Rocket to deliver one, seamlessly integrated creative and media solution.”</p>
						<p class="animate animate--fade-up-25">Massey University Director of Marketing, Recruitment and Alumni, Ruth Mackenzie says,“The University found Federation to be intuitively aligned to the growth and innovation journey it is on. Federation and Rocket impressed our Panel with their creative approach, strategic insight and outside the square digital and media thinking. They showed a real passion and drive for our brand and our future as a university. This came through in every part of their response to our brief. We look forward to achieving great things together.”</p>
						<p class="animate animate--fade-up-25">Managing Partner of Federation Elizabeth Beatty added, “We are thrilled and delighted to be creating the next chapter with the team at Massey University.
