						<p class="animate animate--fade-up-25"><strong>The Company has a long-term strategic agenda that seeks to re-imagine what opera might mean in New Zealand with the goal of becoming a more relevant and inclusive national cultural organisation.</strong></p>
						<p class="animate animate--fade-up-25">Terri Cumiskey, Director of Marketing and Development at NZ Opera says that Federation’s creative and strategic firepower is what’s needed as the Company looks to engage new audiences and reimagine the art form; “Federation has a proven track record of creating impactful and effective work based on strong creative platforms and deep strategic insight. NZ Opera is committed to enhancing and evolving opera by adding a diverse, inclusive lens. Therefore we need an agency who can connect to the changing needs and demands of our current and future audiences.”</p>
